                            <p>Are you someone who shares my passion for building thriving communities with purpose and
                            achieving business goals with them?</p>

                            <p class="lead">Hi, I am Akash Agrawal, A Community Builder by passion and profession.</p>

                            <p> I have successfully crafted vibrant communities for diverse organizations,
                                each with their own unique vision and purpose. </p>
                                                        
                            <p>I have been building communities for more than 2 years, but that's officially. </p>
                            
                            <p>The truth is, that community building has been a part of me all along. Even before I knew
                                the formal terminology for it.</p>
                                
                            <p>I built thriving gaming communities of
                                gamers, for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Counter Strike.
                                Expanding them over time by delegating responsibilities to other passionate users. </p>
                            
                            <p> With Community Folks I have built and scaled communities in
                                EdTech, ClimateTech, SAAS,
                                TravelTech, FinTech, Gaming and e-mobility sectors. I am an ex-founder and currently a
                                founding member,
                                which enables me to align the community and business goals </p>
                            
                            <P> Before this, I co-founded a real estate business, led it to success
                                within a year. After successfully handing all the responsibilities to my partners
                                I transitioned to working as a graphic designer for four years before discovering my
                                true calling in <b>community building</b>. </P>
                            
                            <p> I have been hosting online
                                and offline events for all the communities I have worked with.
                                I have also hosted global events with Commsor and Led By Community. </P>
                            
                            <p>I am a founding team member of a TravelTech startup called "Travander."</p>
                            
                            <p> Additionally, I am the Director, Asia for Led By Community focused on enabling the
                                community ecosystem in Asia Pacific.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>My ultimate goal is to bring together like-minded individuals and foster a strong sense
                                of
                                community, while also delivering significant business value.</p>
                            
                            <p>I approach community building with a deep understanding of its transformative potential
                                for
                                businesses. I recognize that a thriving community is more than just a collection of
                                individuals, it is a catalyst for <b>growth, customer loyalty, and brand advocacy</b>. By
                                prioritizing authentic engagement, fostering inclusivity, and cultivating a sense of
                                belonging, I consistently deliver tangible results for the organizations I serve.</p>
                            
                            <p>Helping others and bringing people together is what truly motivates me, and
                                <b>I'm always

                            <p>I'm also a huge animal lover with a soft spot for
                                creatures big and small, whether they reside on land, in the mountains, or in the sea
                                and
