                            <p>Are you someone who shares my passion for building thriving communities and making a positive impact on the world around us?</p>

                        </br>

                            <p class="lead">Hi, I am Akash Agrawal, A Community Builder by passion and profession.</p>

                    </br>
                        
                            <p>Let me introduce myself. In 2015, I founded a business from scratch and successfully scaled it within a year. Following that, I transitioned to working as a graphic designer for four years before discovering my true calling in community building. Throughout my career, I have successfully crafted vibrant communities for diverse organizations, each with their own unique vision and purpose as part of the Community Folks team. I have been hosting online and offline events, including global events with Commsor.</p>  
                            
                            <p>I'm also a founding team member of a travel startup called "Travander." As part of the team, I helped develop a clear business model, design a go-to-market strategy, identify the right demographic, create a community strategy, and launch it with internal members.</p>

                            <p>But the truth is, community building has been a part of me all along. Even before I knew the formal terminology for it, I was creating successful gaming communities on Discord and expanding them over time by delegating responsibilities to other passionate users.</p>

                            <p>My ultimate goal is to bring together like-minded individuals and foster a strong sense of community, while also delivering significant business value.</p>

                            <p>I approach community building with a deep understanding of its transformative potential for businesses. I recognize that a thriving community is more than just a collection of individuals—it is a catalyst for growth, customer loyalty, and brand advocacy. By prioritizing authentic engagement, fostering inclusivity, and cultivating a sense of belonging, I consistently deliver tangible results for the organizations I serve.</p>

                            <p>Helping others and bringing people together is what truly motivates me, and I'm always just a ping away! Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a huge animal lover with a soft spot for creatures big and small, whether they reside on land, in the mountains, or in the sea and sky?</p>

                            <p>According to me,</p>
